# GCN_homework

In this homework we will explore the basics of the Pytorch-Geometric Package through an initial tutorial and implement different a state of the art Graph Neural Networks to solve a node classification task in the OGBN-Proteins dataset.

# Part 0: Installation

The [Installation file](deepgcn_env_install.txt) contains all needed comands with respect to the installation of required packages and the activation of the respective environment in anaconda. It is recommended to run all lines sequentially.

# Part 1: Pytorch Geometric Tutorial (0.5 points)

The `PyTorch Geometric Tutorial` folder contains the [tutorial file](https://github.com/g27182818/GCN_homework/blob/7e4b826915b055442b79ebf4c981dc50ae44a111/PyTorch%20Geometric%20Tutorial/TorchGeometric_tutorial.py) which is a step by step guide to the construction of a basig graph neural network using the [Zachary's karate club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club) dataset. This tutorial is an adaptation from the [original](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h3-vJGRVloF5zStxL5I0rSy4ZUPNsjy8?usp=sharing#scrollTo=ci-LpZWhRJoI) by [MATTHIAS FEY](https://rusty1s.github.io/#/). Please remit to the folder for detailed instructions.
