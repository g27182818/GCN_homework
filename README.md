# GCN_homework

In this homework we will explore the basics of the Pytorch-Geometric Package through an initial tutorial and implement different a state of the art Graph Neural Networks to solve a node classification task in the OGBN-Proteins dataset.

# Part 0: Installation

The [Installation file](deepgcn_env_install.txt) contains all needed comands with respect to the installation of required packages and the activation of the respective environment in anaconda. It is recommended to run all lines sequentially.
