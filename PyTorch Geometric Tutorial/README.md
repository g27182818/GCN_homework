# PyTorch Geometric Tutorial (0.5 points)
This tutorial was originaly concived as a notebook but is provided as a python file for ease in dynamic ploting. It will not require important computational resources and can be executed locally without a GPU. Excecusion of individual cells is recommended.

PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is an extension library for PyTorch. It provides useful primitives to develop Graph Deep Learning models, including various graph neural network layers and a large number of benchmark datasets. The following instalations will be required in case you are running this tutorial in your own machine and have not installed the packages ennumerated in the installation file.

```
pip install networkx
pip install torch
pip install -q torch-scatter -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0+cu101.html
pip install -q torch-sparse -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.7.0+cu101.html
pip install -q torch-geometric
```
